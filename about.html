            <h2>The Path to Architecture</h2>
            <p>My journey to architecture wasn't traditional. Before I ever drafted a floor plan, I spent years in
                direct service—experiences that fundamentally shaped how I approach design.</p>
            <p>At HASC Center in Brooklyn, I served as Senior Counselor for residents with developmental disabilities. I
                designed personalized care plans, managed crisis interventions, and learned that environments directly
                impact behavior, dignity, and quality of life. A well-designed space isn't a luxury—it's therapeutic.
            </p>
            <p>As an NYPD Auxiliary Police Officer in the 69th Precinct, I supported law enforcement during emergencies,
                public events, and mental health crises. I saw firsthand how the built environment affects public
                safety, community trust, and outcomes for vulnerable populations.</p>
            <p>These experiences led me to architecture school with a clear purpose: design spaces that serve people at
                their most vulnerable moments.</p>

            <h2>Professional Background</h2>
            <p>Today, I'm recognized as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) in Justice Design and Behavioral Health Facility
                Design. Over the past decade, I've contributed to some of the most significant civic projects in the
                country:</p>

            <h3>NYC Borough-Based Jails (2019-2024)</h3>
            <p>Led design for the facilities replacing Rikers Island—high-rise detention centers in Manhattan, Brooklyn,
                The Bronx, and Queens. Three years focused on security compliance, therapeutic environments, and humane
                design within strict operational requirements.</p>

            <h3>Behavioral Health Facilities</h3>
            <p>Designed therapeutic treatment centers including the Baltimore Therapeutic Treatment Center and OTxHU
                Woodhull Hospital, balancing clinical requirements with environments that support mental well-being and
                recovery.</p>

            <h3>Civic & Courthouse Projects</h3>
            <p>Morris County Courthouse (NJ), Macomb County Jail expansion (MI), and justice facilities for Native
                American tribal communities—each requiring careful attention to cultural context, security, and public
                service.</p>

            <h3>Emergency Response</h3>
            <p>During COVID-19, I served as on-site lead for the US Army Corps of Engineers, converting an athletic
                complex into a 1,024-bed Alternate Care Facility in 28 days.</p>
